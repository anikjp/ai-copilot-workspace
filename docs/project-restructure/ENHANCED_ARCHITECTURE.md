# AJ Copilot - Enhanced Multi-Frontend Architecture

## 🎯 **Your Vision:**

- **Multiple frontend applications** for different AI agents
- **Shared core backend services** across all frontends
- **Current project** = "Bank" of all AI agents in one place
- **Future projects** = Separate web apps for specific AI agents

## 🏗️ **Proposed Project Structure:**

## 🐳 **Docker Architecture:**

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  postgres:
    image: pgvector/pgvector:pg16
    ports: ["5432:5432"]
  
  auth-service:
    build: ./apps/auth-service
    ports: ["8001:8000"]

## 🚀 **Development Workflow:**

### **1. Shared Development:**

- Work on `shared-ui/`, `shared-types/`, `shared-utils/`
- Update `agent-sdk/` for new agent features
- Enhance `core-api/` for new capabilities

### **2. Frontend Development:**

- Each app can be developed independently
- Use shared packages for consistency
- Deploy individually or together

### **3. Agent Development:**

- Add new agents to `agno-agents/`
- Update `core-api/` for agent configuration
- Update `agent-sdk/` for new agent types

## 📊 **Benefits:**

### **✅ Scalability:**

- **Independent scaling** of each frontend
- **Shared backend services** reduce duplication
- **Microservice architecture** for flexibility

### **✅ Development:**

- **Team specialization** by domain
- **Shared components** reduce development time
- **Independent deployment** of frontends

### **✅ User Experience:**

- **Specialized interfaces** for each use case
- **Unified authentication** across all apps
- **Consistent design** through shared UI

### **✅ Business:**

- **Market-specific apps** for different industries
- **Agent-specific branding** and features
- **Flexible pricing** per application

## 🎯 **Implementation Phases:**

### **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure**

1. Create `auth-service/` and `core-api/`
2. Set up shared packages
3. Migrate current `simple-agent-ui/` to `agent-bank/`

### **Phase 2: First Specialized App**

1. Create `stock-analyst/` app
2. Extract stock-specific features from `agent-bank/`
3. Implement shared UI components

### **Phase 3: Additional Apps**

1. Create `business-processor/` app
2. Create `ringi-system/` app
3. Create `hr-assistant/` and `it-support/` apps

### **Phase 4: Enhancement**

1. Add cross-app features
2. Implement agent marketplace
3. Add analytics and reporting

## 🔄 **Migration Plan:**

### **Current → New Structure:**

```
simple-agent-ui/ → agent-bank/
agno-agents/auth/ → auth-service/
agno-agents/shared/ → core-api/
agno-agents/agents/ → agno-agents/
```

### **New App Creation:**

1. Copy `agent-bank/` as template
2. Customize for specific agent
3. Remove unused features
4. Add agent-specific features
5. Update shared packages
