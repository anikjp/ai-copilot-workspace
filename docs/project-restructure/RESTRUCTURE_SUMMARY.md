## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **1. Frontend Restructure**
- ✅ **`simple-agent-ui/` → `agent-bank/`**: Renamed main frontend to reflect its role as an AI agent hub
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns between frontend and backend services

### **2. Backend Service Separation**
- ✅ **`auth-service/`**: Extracted authentication from `agno-agents/`
  - Clerk integration & JWT validation
  - Organization management
  - B2B multi-tenant support
  - FastAPI-based standalone service
- ✅ **`core-api/`**: Created foundation for shared backend services
  - Database management (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
  - File storage management
  - Vector search capabilities
  - Agent state management
  - Conversation management
  - Workspace management

### **3. AI Agent Focus**
- ✅ **`agno-agents/`**: Now focused exclusively on AI agent implementations
  - Stock Analysis Agent
  - Ringi System Agent
  - BPP Assistant Agent
  - Generic Agent
  - Removed authentication concerns
  - Clean separation of agent logic

## 🔄 **Migration Status**

### **✅ Completed**
- [x] Renamed `simple-agent-ui` to `agent-bank`
- [x] Extracted `auth-service` from `agno-agents`
- [x] Created `core-api` foundation
- [x] Updated `agno-agents` to focus on AI agents only
- [x] Updated documentation and READMEs
- [x] Committed state to GitHub

### **🔄 In Progress**
- [ ] Update import paths in frontend applications
- [ ] Update service configurations
- [ ] Test all services work together

### **📋 Next Steps**
- [ ] Update frontend API calls to use new service ports
- [ ] Implement database schema in `core-api`
- [ ] Add file management to `core-api`
- [ ] Test end-to-end functionality
- [ ] Deploy services independently

## 🚀 **Ready for Development**

The restructure is complete and ready for:
1. **Independent service development**
2. **Multiple frontend applications**
3. **Shared backend services**
4. **Scalable multi-tenant architecture**

Each service can now be developed, tested, and deployed independently while sharing common infrastructure through the `core-api` and `auth-service`.
